# Music_Player_and_Visualizer

Using the web dev stack (HTML, CSS and javascript), made an audio player which runs on the browser. Plays songs of the user's selection which are present on the local disk. Used Web Audio API to extract real-time information while the song is playing. Using the information and with the help of D3.js created visualizations which adapt to the song currently playing.

The visualizer is currenty hosted at www.mviz.co.nf

NOTE: Post a specific version of Chrome, the visaulizer no longer works for it. Will need to dig deep to figure out what's happening. Still working fine on firefox and Edge (tested on windows).
